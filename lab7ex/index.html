<h3>Drunk in Dublin </h3>

<p>Throwin' back pints with the locals in Dublin this past summer made me really appreciate the pub culture. The top three bars in Dublin for <q>craic</q> (i.e. good fun) in order of preference are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Davy Byrne's </li>
  <li>Kehoe's </li>
</ol>

<p><em>The price of a pint of beer is about €5. Although would recommend the cider (around €8 a pint).</em></p>
